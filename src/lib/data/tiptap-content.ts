  Project Name: Residential Building Renovation<br>
  Address: 1482 34th Ave, Santa Clara CA 94122<br>
  Permit Application: BLD-2023-0123
</p>
<h2>Code Compliance Review</h2>
<p>
  The following items need to be addressed before the permit can be issued:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Provide complete structural calculations for the proposed modifications.</li>
  <li>Update the egress plan to show compliance with CBC Section 1006.</li>
  <li>Revise the electrical plan to include load calculations.</li>
  <li>Show compliance with energy efficiency requirements per Title 24.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Building Code Analysis</h2>
<p>
  Based on our review of the submitted plans, we have identified the following building code issues that need to be addressed:
</p>

<h3>Structural Requirements</h3>
<p>
  The structural plans submitted do not adequately address the lateral force requirements for the proposed modifications. Please provide detailed calculations showing compliance with ASCE 7-16 for wind and seismic loads. The foundation details need to be revised to show proper connection to the existing structure.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, the roof framing plan does not provide sufficient information regarding the proposed roof loads. Please provide detailed calculations for both dead and live loads, and show how these loads are transferred to the supporting walls and foundation.
</p>

<h3>Fire and Life Safety</h3>
<p>
  The current plans do not adequately address fire separation requirements between the main dwelling unit and the proposed accessory dwelling unit. Please revise the plans to show a minimum 1-hour fire-resistance-rated separation in accordance with CBC Section 420.2.
</p>
<p>
  The egress plan needs to be updated to show compliance with CBC Section 1006. Each habitable space must have at least one emergency escape and rescue opening in accordance with CBC Section 1030. The current plans do not show compliant emergency escape windows in bedrooms 2 and 3.
</p>

<h3>Accessibility Requirements</h3>
<p>
  The bathroom in the accessory dwelling unit does not meet the minimum accessibility requirements. Please revise the plans to provide at least one bathroom that complies with CBC Chapter 11A, including appropriate clear floor space at fixtures, grab bar reinforcement, and accessible controls.
</p>
<p>
  The entry door to the accessory dwelling unit must have a minimum clear width of 32 inches and maneuvering clearances in compliance with CBC Section 1126A. The current plans show a 30-inch door with insufficient clearance on the pull side.
</p>

<h2>Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing</h2>

<h3>Mechanical Systems</h3>
<p>
  The HVAC plans do not provide sufficient information regarding the proposed heating and cooling systems. Please provide detailed specifications for all mechanical equipment, including BTU ratings, efficiency ratings, and duct layouts. All systems must comply with the California Mechanical Code and Title 24 energy efficiency requirements.
</p>
<p>
  Ventilation calculations must be provided for all habitable spaces in accordance with CMC Section 402. The current plans do not show adequate ventilation for the kitchen and bathrooms in the accessory dwelling unit.
</p>

<h3>Electrical Systems</h3>
<p>
  The electrical plans need to be revised to include a complete load calculation for the entire building, including the existing dwelling unit and the proposed accessory dwelling unit. The service panel appears to be undersized for the additional loads.
</p>
<p>
  GFCI protection must be provided for all outlets in bathrooms, kitchens, garages, and outdoor locations in accordance with CEC Article 210.8. The current plans do not clearly indicate GFCI protection for all required locations.
</p>

<h3>Plumbing Systems</h3>
<p>
  The plumbing plans must be revised to show the complete water distribution system, including pipe sizes, materials, and fixture unit calculations. The current plans do not provide sufficient information to verify compliance with the California Plumbing Code.
</p>
<p>
  The proposed water heater installation does not comply with CPC Section 507 regarding seismic bracing and temperature/pressure relief valve discharge. Please revise the plans to show compliant installation details.
</p>

<h2>Energy Compliance</h2>
<p>
  The submitted Title 24 energy calculations do not accurately reflect the proposed building envelope and mechanical systems. Please provide updated calculations that include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete building envelope details, including insulation R-values for all walls, floors, and ceilings</li>
  <li>Window schedules with U-factors and Solar Heat Gain Coefficients</li>
  <li>HVAC equipment specifications and efficiency ratings</li>
  <li>Water heating system details and efficiency ratings</li>
  <li>Lighting plans showing compliance with mandatory requirements</li>
</ul>

<h2>Zoning and Planning Requirements</h2>
<p>
  The proposed accessory dwelling unit must comply with all applicable zoning requirements, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maximum floor area ratio (FAR)</li>
  <li>Setback requirements</li>
  <li>Height limitations</li>
  <li>Parking requirements</li>
  <li>Lot coverage restrictions</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The current plans exceed the maximum allowed FAR for the RH-2 zoning district. Please revise the plans to reduce the total floor area or seek a variance from the Planning Department.
</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
  Please revise and resubmit the plans addressing all the items listed above. Once all items are addressed, the permit will be ready for issuance. If you have any questions or need clarification on any of the requirements, please contact the plan checker assigned to your project.
</p>
<p>
  We recommend scheduling a pre-application meeting with the Planning Department to discuss the FAR issue before submitting revised plans.
